# Introduction
  My name is **Nick Heislen**, I am a junior _CS/Software Developement major_ here at Missouri State.  So far learning about _GitHub_ has been very interesting and there are many cool features.  Learning about the basic flow of creating forks, branches, pull requests, and commits has helped me to understand the flow of GitHub a bit better.  However, there seems to be so much to learn still that it is a little overwhelming at times, so I have had to try to break down the more important information to retain vs the less important. ðŸ˜„  I am super excited to continue to learn more about GitHub and for it to become a tool that I use for all of my projects.
