# Introduction
  My name is **Nick Heislen**, I am a junior _CS/Software Developement major_ here at Missouri State.  I transferred here last winter from Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas.
At Benedictine College I played football and studied *Criminology* for the first year.  I took my first programming class at Benedictine and loved it so I decided to pursue a degree
in Computer Science.  As an athlete that used to think that I would never work in an office, I am always so impressed with my classmate's abilities and knowledge with technology in 
which I lack to a certain degree.üòÅ However, I am super excited to learn more and try to advance my own skills by learning from courses and my classmates. I also love to push myself 
mentally and physically through excercise.  I currently have set the goals of training for triathlons and one day being able to comlete the Ironman.  This, of course, is a huge undertaking
and I am far from accomplishing that goal.  However, I always love a good challenge and setting my goals high.

### Some of the things that I love about Computer Science:
+ The challenge of pushing myself intellectually and my ability to solve problems
- Every project is like logic puzzle or building an machine that takes inputs and gives outputs
* It is an opportunity to make people's lives better and make a difference, whether it be large or small
